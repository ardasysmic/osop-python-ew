Introducing *Python* into the Earthworm picture will allow new people to come in and contribute.\r\n\r\nAlthough these modules are far from complete, they are currently quite functional and usable; the ```Tracebuf2``` module specially, is already being used in production scenarios, and it has proven to be a very usefull tool.\r\n\r\n**MODULE OVERVIEW**\r\n\r\nA module consists of one *C* and two *Python* sources. The *C* source are basically Python-wrapped functions that allow Read/Write operations of a certain Earthworm datatype. One of the *Python* source contains interfaces to the *C* wrapped functions; the other *Python* source is a basic setup tool.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nTracebuf2\r\n    tracebuf2module/\r\n        tracebuf2module.c\r\n        tracebuf2ring.py\r\n        trace_setup.py\r\n```\r\nIn order to use a module from *Python*, the *C* source, in this case ```tracebuf2module.c```, needs to be compiled into a dynamically linked library that *Python* can load.\r\n\r\n**HOW TO INSTALL**\r\n\r\nIn order to follow theses steps, Earthworm needs to be previously\r\ninstalled in your computer. Also, note that these are steps for GNU/Linux - UNIX only.\r\n\r\n1. Use the makefile included in ```ring_access/Makefile``` to create ```ringwriter.o``` and ```ringreader.o```. Once created, copy them into the Earthworm's ```/bin/``` directory. Note that you need to edit the ```INCLUDE``` and ```LIBRARIES``` variables in the makefile to match your Earthworm installation. These are libraries and binaries needed by all the modules.\r\n\r\n2. Copy ```ringwriter.h``` and ```ringreader.h``` into the Earthworm's ```/include/``` directory.\r\n\r\n3. Choose the module you want to compile and simply run the corresponding python setup script.\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n    ```python trace_setup.py build```\r\n\r\nThis will create a dynamically linked library corresponding to the module, and it's the one\r\nthat the python module will try to load.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
